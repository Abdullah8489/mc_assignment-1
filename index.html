    <h1>Hey! It's Me Abdullah.</h1>
    <p>In this webpage, you will see how we can create a local repository and push it on you github account.</p>
    <h3>Version Control System</h3>
    <img src="g1.PNG" alt="P1">
    <p>Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 
    <br> As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.</p>
    <h2>Hosting webpages on GitHub</h2>
    <p>First of all you need to create an account on github.</p>
    <img src="g2.PNG" alt="P2">
    <p>Make an html file on your system and write some code in it.</p>
    <img src="g3.PNG" alt="P3">
    <p>Then, you need to run the command <b>git init</b> in your vs code terminal.</p>
    <img src="g4.PNG" alt="P4">
    <p>A hideen .git folder will be created in your current working directory <br> in which all the 
    information regarding push request, pull request, git status and everything you will do with git.</p>
    <p>You can check the status by using the command <b>git status</b>, it will tell you that which <br>
        files are not been added, which files are at the staging phase etc.</p>
    <img src="g5.PNG" alt="P5">
    <p>Then, you need to run the command <b>git add {filename} or . (to add all the files in the staging phase)</b></p>
    <img src="g6.PNG" alt="P6">
    <p>Now you can commit your work by using the command <b>git commit -m (any message)</b></p>
    <img src="g7.PNG" alt="P7">
    <p>Make a repository on Git-Hub and copy the http link as mentioned below. <br>
        Run the command <b>git remote add origin (http Link)</b></p>

    <h1>Git Branch Concept</h1>
    <p>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. 
        <br> Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. 
        <br> When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or 
        <br> how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.</p>
    <p>In order to get the details of git branch, you can visit the do so by clicking on the 
        following link: </p>
    <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches#:~:text=In%20Git%2C%20branches%20are%20a,branch%20to%20encapsulate%20your%20changes." target="_blank">Git Branch in Detail</a>
    <h3>Git Staging</h3>
    <p>A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, <br>
        and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes <br>
        in small commits. Suppose you have edited three files (a.html, b.html, and c.html). <br>
        After that you need to commit all the changes so that the changes to a.html and b.html were a <br>
        single commit, while the changes to c.html were not logically associated with the first two files <br>
        and were done in a separate commit.</p>
